# ðŸ§  Brain Tumor Detection using CNN 
 
This project implements a **binary image classification** model to detect **brain tumors** from MRI images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and finetune with **ResNet50** as a feature extractor.  
The model is trained and evaluated using **PyTorch**, with modularized code for data preprocessing, model definition, training, and evaluation.
